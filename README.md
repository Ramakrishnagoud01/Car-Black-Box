# Car-Black-Box
Car Black Box is an embedded C project that records vehicle data like speed, gear, and sudden events using a PIC microcontroller. It logs timestamped events and displays them on a CLCD. Built with MPLAB X and XC8, it demonstrates GPIO, ADC, timers, interrupts, and EEPROM logging for basic automotive data recording.
